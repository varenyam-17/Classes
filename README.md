# Classes
## Aim: 
To study and implement the concept of Classes and Objects in object-oriented programming.
## Theory:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) organizes code around objects rather than actions.
- Objects encapsulate data and functions that operate on that data.
- This approach enhances modularity, reusability, and maintainability.
- OOP makes code easier to understand, especially for new developers or during code reviews.
- It reduces complexity by grouping related logic and data, avoiding large monolithic files.
## üõ†Ô∏è Tool Used
- C++ Programming Language with support for class-based structure and encapsulation.
## Functions Used
### Class Definition:
Declares a blueprint for objects.
- ### Object Instantiation:
- Creates instances of the class.
- ###  Member Variables:
- Store object-specific data.
-  ### Member Functions:
-  Perform operations like calculating volume or displaying output.
-  ### Access Specifiers:
-  #### public:
-  Accessible from outside the class.
-  #### private:
-  Restricted to internal class use.
- ### Input/Output Operations:
- Using cin and cout for user interaction and result display.
- ## ALGORITHM:
-
