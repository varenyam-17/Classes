# Classes
## Aim: 
To study and implement the concept of Classes and Objects in object-oriented programming.
## Theory:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) organizes code around objects rather than actions.
- Objects encapsulate data and functions that operate on that data.
- This approach enhances modularity, reusability, and maintainability.
- OOP makes code easier to understand, especially for new developers or during code reviews.
- It reduces complexity by grouping related logic and data, avoiding large monolithic files.
## üõ†Ô∏è Tool Used
- C++ Programming Language with support for class-based structure and encapsulation.
## Functions Used
### Class Definition:
Declares a blueprint for objects.
- ### Object Instantiation:
- Creates instances of the class.
- ###  Member Variables:
- Store object-specific data.
-  ### Member Functions:
-  Perform operations like calculating volume or displaying output.
-  ### Access Specifiers:
-  #### public:
-  Accessible from outside the class.
-  #### private:
-  Restricted to internal class use.
- ### Input/Output Operations:
- Using cin and cout for user interaction and result display.
- ## ALGORITHM:
- ### üìê 1. Area of Rectangle

- Start
- Define a class Rectangle with length and breadth as data members
- Include member functions to input values and calculate area
- Create an object of the class
- Call input and area functions
- Display the result
- End
- ### üßÆ 2. Area of Rectangle Calculator
Algorithm:
- Start
- Define class AreaCalculator with private members length, breadth
- Add public functions: getData(), calculateArea(), displayArea()
- Create object and invoke functions in sequence
- Display computed area
- End
###  3. Car Details
Algorithm:
- Start
- Define class Car with members: make, model, year, engineType
- Add functions to input and display car details
- Create object and call input/display functions
- End
###  4. Student Details
Algorithm:
- Start
- Define class Student with members: name, rollNo, course, marks
- Include functions to input and display student data
- Create object and invoke functions
- End
- ###  Volume Calculation
Algorithm:
- Start
- Define class Volume with members: length, breadth, height
- Add functions: inputData(), calculateVolume(), displayVolume()
- Create object and execute functions
- Display volume
- End
- ## Conclusion:
- 
- Classes and objects are foundational to OOP, enabling encapsulation, abstraction, and code reuse.
- By implementing classes, developers can model real-world entities more intuitively.
- The experiment demonstrates how data and behavior can be bundled together, improving clarity and reducing errors.
- Using access specifiers ensures data protection and controlled interaction, reinforcing good design principles.
